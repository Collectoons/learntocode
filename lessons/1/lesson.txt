In this lesson Travis learned how to use the linux command line,
including the commands ls, cat, mkdir, touch, vim, rm, cd, less and git

Travis also learned the very basics of git, including:
 -staging files to be committed (using git add),
 -removing staged files (prompt shows up when staged files are present, using git status)
 -committing (git commit -m "YOURMESSAGE"
 -pushing (git push)
 -using Personal Access Tokens (PAT) instead of password

Finally, travis learned how to create a python file on the command line,
how to run it, how to debug it, and by the end wrote their first "hello world" program
